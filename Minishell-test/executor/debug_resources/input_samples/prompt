You are given a series of shell commands and are required to break them down into tokens, each with a corresponding type and priority. Please format your output in the following way:

Types:

COMMAND = 0;

ARGUMENT = 1;

NONE = 2;

> = 3;

< = 4;

>> = 5;

<< = 6;

| = 7;

&& = 8;

|| = 9;

Output Format:

For each case, output the following:

case: <command>
[TestX, <number_of_tokens> token]
Token = <token_content>, <type>, <priority>,
[END]
Example Input:

case: make frm

Expected output:

case: make frm
[Test0, 2 token]
Token = make, 0, 0,
Token = frm, 1, 0,
[END]
case: ls file1.txt | grep "error" > output.txt

Expected output:

case: ls file1.txt | grep "error" > output.txt
[Test1, 7 token]
Token = ls, 		0, 0,
Token = >,			3, 0,
Token = file1.txt, 	2, 0,
Token = |, 			7, 0,
Token = grep, 		0, 0,
Token = "error", 	1, 0,
Token = >,			3, 0,
Token = output.txt, 2, 0,
[END]
Instructions for Processing:

Tokens should be identified and categorized according to the rules provided.

Tokens number must be equal or bigger the number of tokens.

Both redirection signs (e.g., >, <, >>, <<) and the content of the redirection (e.g., file names) should be included as tokens.

The token order should match the sequence in the command line input.
